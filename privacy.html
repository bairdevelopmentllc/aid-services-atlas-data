          We built Aid &amp; Services Atlas to respect people, including their data.
          This policy explains what we collect, what we do not collect, and how you can control it.

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>No Ads and No Tracking. We do not sell personal information.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>We do not require an account</strong> to use the directory.</li>
          <li><strong>Location is optional</strong> and used to show nearby services.</li>
          <li><strong>Offline-first design</strong> means data can remain on your device.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Information we may collect</h2>
        <h3>1) Location (only if you allow it)</h3>
        <p>
          If you grant location permission, the app can use your approximate location to suggest nearby resources.
          You can still browse by manually choosing a state, county, or ZIP.
        </p>

        <h3>2) Messages you send us</h3>
        <p>
          If you email us or submit feedback, we receive what you send (your email address and message contents).
          We use it only to respond, troubleshoot, or improve the project.
        </p>

        <h3>3) Basic website logs</h3>
        <p>
          Like most websites, our hosting provider may record basic access logs (for example, IP address, browser type,
          and requested pages) for security and performance. We do not use these logs to identify you.
        </p>

        <h2>Information we do not collect</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>No advertising ID collection.</li>
          <li>No sale of personal information.</li>
          <li>No user profiling for any reason.</li>
          <li>No requirement to create an account.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How we use information</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>To show relevant resources (for example, near your area if enabled).</li>
          <li>To respond to support requests and stewardship inquiries.</li>
          <li>To protect the site and data from abuse.</li>
          <li>To improve accuracy and usability.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data storage and retention</h2>
        <p>
          The directory data is designed to be cached locally for speed and offline use.
          If you uninstall the app, local app data is removed by your device’s operating system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Emails and support messages may be retained as long as needed to address your request, comply with legal
          obligations, or maintain project records.
        </p>

        <h2>Third-party services</h2>
        <p>
          We may rely on standard infrastructure providers (for example, standard internet traffic, domain, and hosting services).
          If we add optional services (analytics, crash reporting, payments), we will update this policy and provide
          clear choices where required.
        </p>
		
		<h2>Donations and payments</h2>
			<p>
			  If you choose to donate, your payment is processed by the platform or payment provider you use
			  (for example, Apple In-App Purchase, Google Play Billing, or another payment processor).
			  We do not receive or store your full payment card details.
			</p>
			<p>
			  Depending on the provider, we may receive a limited record of the transaction such as the donation
			  amount, date/time, a product or tier name, and a transaction identifier. We use this only for
			  accounting, support (for example, troubleshooting a failed donation), and fraud prevention.
			</p>
			<p>
			  Refunds, receipts, and subscription management (if offered) are handled by the platform or payment
			  provider according to their policies.
			</p>

		<h2>Children’s privacy</h2>
        <p>
          Aid &amp; Services Atlas is intended for the general public. We do not knowingly collect personal information
          from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided personal information, contact us and we will
          address it.
        </p>

        <h2>Your choices</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Location:</strong> You can enable or disable location access in device settings at any time.</li>
          <li><strong>Manual browsing:</strong> You can always choose a state/county without sharing location.</li>
          <li><strong>Contact:</strong> You can request that we delete your support email thread (where feasible).</li>
        </ul>
